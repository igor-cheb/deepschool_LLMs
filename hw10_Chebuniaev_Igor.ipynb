            "Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.\n",
            "Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n",
            "“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n",
            "“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”\n",
            "High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\n",
            "The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
            "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",
            "Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n",
            "“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.\n",
            "He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”\n",

Is this miliatary coup similar to others coups in the past in Niger which have been due to local conflicts between the influential French agents in this former French colony, or is it a reflection of international conconflict? May Allah reward you!\\nAnswer: Yes, indeed this military coup has taken place as you have mentioned, and they have declared formation of a ’Higher Council of Restoration of Democracy’ under the chairmanship of Salo Jeebo, the commander of the Support Unit in Niami which includes heavy armours like battle tanks.

This indicates that France was not expecting this miliatry coup against it agent Mohammed Tanja to take place this quickly although it was aware about the presence of such military soldiers but it presumed that they were an', 'miliatry coup against it agent Mohammed Tanja to take place this quickly although it was aware about the presence of such military soldiers but it presumed that they were an ineffective minority who are not in a position to stage a coup.

France had expressed its displeasure over the coup and it was executed despite this. The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said: “France condemns any unconstitutional takeover of authority and calls for dialogue between the rebels and the president.’’ [Free American Channel: 19.02.2010].

This statement of the French spokesman reiterates that France was opposed to the rebels and wants dialogue to restore the deposed president, which implies that the coup was staged against France.\\n4. The French news agency A.F.P on 19th February, 2010 quoted an unnamed American official in Washington saying: “ Indeed he [Tanja] has no one to blame for the coup but himself.’’ A.F.P and other news agencies also carried another report on the same day that the US State Department spokesman Phillip Crowley had stated: “This is difficult situation, President Tanja was trying to', 'other news agencies also carried another report on the same day that the US State Department spokesman Phillip Crowley had stated: “This is difficult situation, President Tanja was trying to extend his term.

This was', 'and the statements of the US State Department Spokesman indicate that the coup is acceptable to the US and it hold the deposed president Tanja responsible for it. This was implied in the refernece to Tanja attempt to extend his term by three years through a referendum held last August to effect changes in the constitution. The opposition forces had then opposed the move and the political situation in the country had become tense. Tanja had been elected twice after the coup carried out by troops led by Brigadier Dawood Malaam Wanki in 1999. the constitution of Niger does not', 'country had become tense. Tanja had been elected twice after the coup carried out by troops led by Brigadier Dawood Malaam Wanki in 1999. the constitution of Niger does not allow a third term for a candidate and hence it was amended.

Similarly, Tanja had dissolved the parliament on 26th May, last after which parliamentary elections were held November last which were won by the opposition.\\nAmerica’s reference to the extension of term is it', 'had dissolved the parliament on 26th May, last after which parliamentary elections were held November last which were won by the opposition.\\nAmerica’s reference to the extension of term is it to lay responsibility on the president and thereby justify the military coup. Also the US State Department Spokesman did not call for either restoration of the deposed president nor for dialogue between the rebels and the deposed president.

It was a French colony under its direct rule and was given nominal independence in the year 1960, but the French influence continued there in all spheres.

This', 'French to protect its nuclear interests, since Niger is third largest producer of Uranium in the world and it is the French companies that have invested in Uranium production.

Due to Niger’s importance as a Uranium producer, especially since it is financed by the French companies, it is unlikely that Americans will gain access there so easily and France is not likely to abandon its colony without resisting the US.

Davis said that means leadership makes it part of their organizational routine to continually look at and identify ahead of time the risks of the workplace. That includes off-duty time, and combat or contingency operations. They can', 'part of their organizational routine to continually look at and identify ahead of time the risks of the workplace. That includes off-duty time, and combat or contingency operations. They can then use what they have identified to find ways to minimize that risk.\\nThe Army has a cadre of safety professionals, Davis said, who must manage the Army safety and occupational health program efficiently and effectively. That too is a goal outlined in the plan.\\n\"Our safety professionals in particular are providing tremendous dividends for our Soldiers both at home when they are in garrison doing training and preparatory activity, and when', 'outlined in the plan.\\n\"Our safety professionals in particular are providing tremendous dividends for our Soldiers both at home when they are in garrison doing training and preparatory activity, and when they forward deploy on contingency operations,\" Davis said.\\nEnsuring career paths, career planning and training for those professionals is important, Davis said. Also important to safety program management is the process of fielding a single reporting system to the entire Army that will assist leaders and supervisors at every level in doing a better job of reporting accidents when they occur. Until now, the Army\\'s had as many as eight systems', 'that will assist leaders and supervisors at every level in doing a better job of reporting accidents when they occur. Until now, the Army\\'s had as many as eight systems for accident reporting, Davis said.\\nFinally, the reduction of the accident and illness rates in the Army is a very broad goal included in the plan. That goal is accomplished through programs at every installation and organization within the Army, Davis said.\\n\"The Safety Center down at Fort Rucker has developed a host of leading edge initiatives in the areas of privately owned vehicles and driving safety to motorcycle safety in particular\"', 'said.\\n\"The Safety Center down at Fort Rucker has developed a host of leading edge initiatives in the areas of privately owned vehicles and driving safety to motorcycle safety in particular\" to further the Army\\'s accident reduction goals, Davis said, adding that there\\'s good feedback coming from those programs.\\nThere were 299 accidental fatalities among Soldiers in fiscal year 2005; that number dropped to 240 in 2006, rose slightly to 250 in 2007, dropped again to 210 in 2008, and then dropped again to 173 in 2009.

So far this year, there are 99 accidental fatalities in the Army -- less than the number of deaths at the same time each year since 2005.\\n\"We\\'re doing better now than we did last year, not by much, but I think that we\\'ll continue to show progress,\" Davis said.\\nOf the 99 accidental deaths so far in fiscal year 2010, 27 have been on-duty deaths and 72 were off-duty. Davis said that the number of on-duty accidental deaths is stabilizing and that the number of off-duty', 'in fiscal year 2010, 27 have been on-duty deaths and 72 were off-duty. Davis said that the number of on-duty accidental deaths is stabilizing and that the number of off-duty accidental deaths in the Army is decreasing.\\nThe largest number of those off-duty deaths this year are from accidents in privately owned vehicles -- and those numbers are broken down by vehicle type: 28 from sedans, 16 from motorcycles, and 11 from other vehicles such as vans, SUVs, mopeds or all-terrain vehicles.\\n\"The motorcycle area is one where we spend a lot of time and effort,\" Davis said. \"We have seen a', 'from other vehicles such as vans, SUVs, mopeds or all-terrain vehicles.\\n\"The motorcycle area is one where we spend a lot of time and effort,\" Davis said. \"We have seen a big push at every level within every organization that really focuses on motorcycle safety.

On-duty safety can be improved with training, Davis said. One such example is with the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program.

Carlson, Edgar Payne, and Richard Schmid. These masters, so varied in style and technique, each present beautiful color relationships and truthful representations of nature in their work.\\nFrom years of studying these great artists and from my own experimentation, I have concluded that successful painting can be achieved by paying close attention to a few basic principles. Each one of these steps builds on the previous one, resulting in a system that', 'that successful painting can be achieved by paying close attention to a few basic principles. Each one of these steps builds on the previous one, resulting in a system that virtually guarantees satisfactory results. With this approach, one establishes a solid foundation and mistakes are dealt with early, leaving one free to move into the final painting stages without later disappointment and frustration.\\nStep 1: Establish the ConceptStarting with a strong concept is essential to a painting’s success. The picture’s concept can be a scene, an object, or a person, or it can be a color scheme or composition. For example,', 'concept is essential to a painting’s success. The picture’s concept can be a scene, an object, or a person, or it can be a color scheme or composition. For example, I love painting the West. The light and landscape are wonderful, and there is a wide variety of subjects from which to choose.

For my painting concept I look for unique light, shadow shapes, or moods at different times of day or during various weather conditions. My goal in painting is to make the landscape breathe by depicting the atmosphere and energy of plant life and terrain.\\nStep 2: Experiment With Small SketchesAfter my picture concept has been decided, I create several small sketches, working out my ideas, composition, values, and color plan for the painting. Experience has taught me that I can confidently move into a finished painting', 'I create several small sketches, working out my ideas, composition, values, and color plan for the painting. Experience has taught me that I can confidently move into a finished painting if I have first worked out an interesting composition and pattern of values and color with small studies.

(And Why It Matters)\\nDigital transformation is more than just a buzzword — as noted by Forbes, 70% of companies have already deployed a strategy to improve digital service and solution uptake or are actively working on one.\\nAnd, in 2019 alone, enterprises spent more than 2 trillion dollars worldwide to help drive digital adoption and improve overall organizational performance.\\nFor product and service providers in the technology industry, this presents an opportunity: If B2B sales teams can determine where enterprises are struggling with digital transformation initiatives, they can improve targeted marketing efforts and boost total sales.\\nBut how do', 'this presents an opportunity: If B2B sales teams can determine where enterprises are struggling with digital transformation initiatives, they can improve targeted marketing efforts and boost total sales.\\nBut how do they bridge the gap between potential conversions and practical insight? Technographic data. In this piece, we’ll break down what technographic is (and isn’t), how companies can collect this data at scale, and why this data is important to help enhance B2B sales efforts.\\nLet’s get started.\\nWhat is Technographic Data?\\nTechnographics is a portmanteau of the words “technology” and “demographics”, and refers to information that describes the use of technology solutions, their adoption', 'B2B sales efforts.\\nLet’s get started.\\nWhat is Technographic Data?\\nTechnographics is a portmanteau of the words “technology” and “demographics”, and refers to information that describes the use of technology solutions, their adoption rates, and the potential challenges they present for organizations.\\nThe challenge?

To date, 170 out of the 197 participant nations have ratified the Paris Agreement, which stands as the most comprehensive climate change framework that the United Nations has established to date (2).\\nAlthough the Paris Agreement has noble goals, some members of the scientific community worry that merely slowing down climate change will not be enough to prevent the environment from going “over the edge.” These individuals argue for the proactive', 'of the scientific community worry that merely slowing down climate change will not be enough to prevent the environment from going “over the edge.” These individuals argue for the proactive implementation of geoengineering mechanisms to reverse some of the most crucial environmental changes that have taken place thus far. As defined by the 2010 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, geoengineering mechanisms include “any technologies that deliberately reduce solar insolation or increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere on a large scale that may affect biodiversity” (2). Put simply, the general goal of geoengineering is to decrease the greenhouse effect. This', 'or increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere on a large scale that may affect biodiversity” (2). Put simply, the general goal of geoengineering is to decrease the greenhouse effect. This same United Nations Convention published a moratorium that prohibits field testing of geoengineering techniques by any person; on the other hand, the moratorium allows for “small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting” (2).\\nThe obvious ambiguities of the United Nations’ geoengineering moratorium have prevented any serious enforcement of its policies. In 2012, American entrepreneur Russ George conducted a unilateral iron fertilization experiment off the coast', 'ambiguities of the United Nations’ geoengineering moratorium have prevented any serious enforcement of its policies. In 2012, American entrepreneur Russ George conducted a unilateral iron fertilization experiment off the coast of western Canada (3). One of the main purposes of this experiment was to determine if the influx of iron would help boost the phytoplankton population in the area, since iron is a vital nutrient for phytoplankton and other marine primary producers (3). Higher phytoplankton population is correlated with more photosynthesis, which translates to a greater intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So, the hypothesis in this case is', 'primary producers (3). Higher phytoplankton population is correlated with more photosynthesis, which translates to a greater intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So, the hypothesis in this case is that seeding the ocean with iron leads to greater sequestration and export of atmospheric carbon dioxide; this process should theoretically help reduce global temperatures over the long run by decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (3). George faced a considerable public outcry since he effectively violated the United Nations moratorium on geoengineering (3).\\nAt this point in time, rather than concerning ourselves with the minutiae of international policy,', 'faced a considerable public outcry since he effectively violated the United Nations moratorium on geoengineering (3).\\nAt this point in time, rather than concerning ourselves with the minutiae of international policy, it is much more meaningful for us to debate a more philosophical question: Is geoengineering the future of climate remediation? Geoengineering has only recently burst onto the scientific scene, and it presents a novel approach towards the long-standing issues of global warming and climate change. Below, we shall explore both sides of the debate and see how geoengineering fits into the evolution of science.\\nAdvocates of geoengineering generally argue that efforts', 'global warming and climate change. Below, we shall explore both sides of the debate and see how geoengineering fits into the evolution of science.\\nAdvocates of geoengineering generally argue that efforts to simply slow down global warming have been fairly unsuccessful, thus necessitating proactive corrective action in the form of geoengineering. In a seminal paper, Dutch atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen points out that global carbon dioxide emissions would need to be reduced by 60- 80% to achieve zero net emissions, which is largely unfeasible (4). Crutzen then discusses the merits of spraying sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) into the atmosphere, since SO2', 'reduced by 60- 80% to achieve zero net emissions, which is largely unfeasible (4). Crutzen then discusses the merits of spraying sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) into the atmosphere, since SO2 is known to reflect solar radiation back out into space, thus counteracting the greenhouse effect brought about by CO2 (4). There is fairly convincing empirical evidence that corroborates Crutzen’s case: following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption, which released 17 million tons (15.4 million metric tons) of SO2 , global temperatures dropped by about 0.6 ° C the next year.5 Although SO2 clearly can have a myriad of other side', 'million tons (15.4 million metric tons) of SO2 , global temperatures dropped by about 0.6 ° C the next year.5 Although SO2 clearly can have a myriad of other side effects on the environment (e.g. acid rain), we see that it can potentially be a powerful tool for reversing the current trend of global warming, if we can find a way to harness it correctly. With temperatures increasing at their current rate, such techniques may very well become the only option to keep global temperatures at a sustainable level.\\nOpponents of geoengineering present a fairly strong case as well. One common', 'current rate, such techniques may very well become the only option to keep global temperatures at a sustainable level.\\nOpponents of geoengineering present a fairly strong case as well. One common argument is that geoengineering involves excessive meddling with the environment, which more often than not results in environmental damage. As alluded to previously, SO2 injection often results in acid rain, which arguably has far more detrimental effects on the environment than potential benefits. With regard to iron fertilization in oceans, some geoengineering skeptics point out that massive phytoplankton blooms often form around seeded areas, disrupting the balance of the local', 'than potential benefits. With regard to iron fertilization in oceans, some geoengineering skeptics point out that massive phytoplankton blooms often form around seeded areas, disrupting the balance of the local food chain and sapping other vital nutrients from the waters (3). A second oppositional argument involves the notion of a moral hazard.6 Generally speaking, a moral hazard is where someone develops a solution to a problem, yet the presence of the solution makes people think that they no longer need to care about the problem and can behave as unscrupulously as they please.6 In the case of geoengineering, the moral', 'the solution makes people think that they no longer need to care about the problem and can behave as unscrupulously as they please.6 In the case of geoengineering, the moral hazard would be that if the general public becomes convinced that geoengineering can resolve all environmental issues, then the public will no longer care about using sustainable practices, since they will think that geoengineering can reverse all future damage that is done to the environment. This moral hazard argument generally would come into play at the policymaking stage, since lawmakers would now need to decide how to regulate geoengineering practices.\\nWe', 'is done to the environment. This moral hazard argument generally would come into play at the policymaking stage, since lawmakers would now need to decide how to regulate geoengineering practices.\\nWe thus continue to observe a spirited debate about the merits of geoengineering. This field holds immense promise and should be explored; however, the scientific community must take calculated steps to make sure that geoengineering’s power is harnessed in a manner that is beneficial on the whole to all stakeholders. Going forward, we can expect to see more discussion and exploration of geoengineering in the scientific community, as global warming continues', 'that is beneficial on the whole to all stakeholders.

He was born in Ulm, Germany in 1879 to an engineer/ part-time-salesman and a housewife. Many people with an advanced level of intelligence oftentimes displayed peculiar habits, trends or rituals as children. Things like hypersensitivity, well-developed powers of abstraction, unusual or vivid imagination and a series of other quirks have been traditionally seen to color a genius’s childhood. This was not the case with Albert Einstein. The only peculiar trait Einstein displayed as a child was his aversion to talking. He spoke very little and was effectively mute until somewhere around age 7. In', 'Albert Einstein. The only peculiar trait Einstein displayed as a child was his aversion to talking. He spoke very little and was effectively mute until somewhere around age 7. In response to such preconceived notions, many popular myths have been attributed to him. For instance, it is popularly believed that Einstein was left-handed, had extreme difficulties in school, and possessed other strange quirks. Almost all of these oddities have been determined to be false.\\nUltimately, it should be noted that Albert Einstein had a normal childhood typical of his socio-economic class.

He played music, built models, built mechanical devices and once again, despite common misconceptions to the contrary, showed a strong aptitude for mathematics. From a very early age Einstein studied books on science, math and philosophical books including the Critique of Pure Reason and Euclid’s Elements.

Perhaps ‘smashing coach wheels’ would be a more accurate depiction? ) Einstein was more of a nerd-rebel; most of his acts of rebellion dealt with his aversion to the methods of academic institutions.

He strongly opposed the institutionalized way education was conducted. He frequently rebelled against authority figures in the school system and strongly rejected the teaching methods. In fact, he once wrote that the “true spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict role learning.” (The student in me has to add that this is a very brilliant sentiment.

Though he studied to be a teacher, he was unable to find a teaching position and instead took a position as a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. He spent a few good years in the patent office and managed to obtain his Doctorate degree. During this time he published some of his most remarkable and prolific works including his most famous paper: the Special Theory of Relativity.', 'and managed to obtain his Doctorate degree. During this time he published some of his most remarkable and prolific works including his most famous paper: the Special Theory of Relativity. A paper that yielded previously unknown mysteries of the Universe and what is arguably the most famous equation in the world: e=mc2. It was a formula that revealed, if I understand it correctly, that the speed of light is a constant against which even time and space lose their absolute meaning.

(Though as far as I can tell an existentialist could have told you that much.) In 1909 Einstein became Professor Extraordinary (quite a flashy title) at Zurich, and in 1911 he became a Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague. He returned to Zurich later that year to fulfill a similar post.

Recently the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been testing a new forecasting system that aims to give specific flash flood warnings at least 30 minutes and possibly even 1 to 2 hours before the event. It is difficult to predict when flash floods will occur because they are so sudden.

Although radar can detect heavy rain, it is hard to say whether a storm will stall over a particular area or what specific water source a flood is going to hit. These events depend on a number of factors, including soil and topographic and hydrologic features of the area. The new system provides a synthesis of information on both land and atmosphere, taking both surface conditions and hydrology into account. NCAR scientist David Yates said that the system is “unique in that it provides a detailed forecast', 'on both land and atmosphere, taking both surface conditions and hydrology into account. NCAR scientist David Yates said that the system is “unique in that it provides a detailed forecast of the location and duration of a severe storm, as well as the watershed’s likely response to the heavy rain.

While numerous studies have documented the link between asthma and thunderstorms, this is the first conducted in the Southeastern United States, where thunderstorms and asthma are common.

From more than 10 million emergency room visit records, the team found a 3 percent increase in visits for asthma on days after a thunderstorm.

Increase medication compliance. Mobile technology can help patients adhere to medication orders.

Key takeaways The concept of ESG analysis has evolved over the years and is becoming integral to fundamental credit research. The Corporate Credit Team believes that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns. Sound investment sense, growing client demand and efficient capital allocation underscore the importance and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the', 'and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the ‘Triple Bottom Line’, also known as the ‘People, Planet and Profits’ (PPP), a concept introduced in the 1990s. It argued that businesses should focus on each of the three ‘P’s and not just on ‘Profits’, since they were equally important for any commercial enterprise to be sustainable. This concept evolved into the focus of ESG, which today is the bedrock of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). /> Environmental criteria examine', 'for any commercial enterprise to be sustainable. This concept evolved into the focus of ESG, which today is the bedrock of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). /> Environmental criteria examine how a business contributes to and performs on environmental challenges (e.g. waste, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and climate change). Social criteria look at how the company treats people (e.g. human capital management, diversity and equal opportunities, work conditions, health & safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At', '& safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At the heart of ESG investing is the simple idea that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns1 if they create value for all their stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers and wider society including the environment – and not just the company owners. Consequently, ESG analysis considers how companies serve society and how this impacts their current and future performance. ESG analysis is not just about what the', 'not just the company owners. Consequently, ESG analysis considers how companies serve society and how this impacts their current and future performance. ESG analysis is not just about what the company is doing today. Consideration of future trends is critically important and should inherently include disruptive change that can have significant implications for a company’s future profitability or its very existence. Our approach to ESG analysis We look at companies in-depth from E, S and G perspectives to evaluate their standing relative to peers.

Our ESG philosophy is built on the belief that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns and company engagement is an integral part of successful investing. Just as with other credit metrics, we would expect improving ESG profiles to lead to a lower cost of capital. We believe companies that pursue meaningful ESG improvement should increase the potential to outperform as the cost of capital declines and credit spreads tighten. Conversely, if a company has material ESG risks and is not actively mitigating these', 'should increase the potential to outperform as the cost of capital declines and credit spreads tighten. Conversely, if a company has material ESG risks and is not actively mitigating these risks and improving their ESG profile, it is very likely that its bond prices will suffer. Identifying and measuring ESG risks and opportunities has the benefit of simultaneously supporting environmental and social benefits. There are many ways to incorporate ESG into investment decisions.

The main applications tend to be ethical/values-based investing, integrated ESG and sustainable/impact investing. In ethical investing managers employ a negative screen approach to generate ‘ethical or moral returns’ and screen out controversial ‘sin’ sectors. While negative screening is very straightforward to implement and has historically been used by early adopters of sustainability principles, a growing number of firms are now also aiming to apply ESG in order to take advantage of opportunities and select sectors and companies based on their positive ESG performance.

This leads to a more holistic ESG integration that is better placed to maximise risk-adjusted returns. Impact managers go a step further in applying ESG considerations and aim to deliver positive impact via their investments in companies and governments that generate a measurable net positive impact for society and the environment alongside positive returns. There is no one way to apply ESG, so understanding how an investment manager applies ESG in their investment process in order to achieve the strategy’s objective is important for', 'There is no one way to apply ESG, so understanding how an investment manager applies ESG in their investment process in order to achieve the strategy’s objective is important for clients. Why do we care? Because it makes sound investment sense It is our fundamental belief that ESG considerations enhance risk-adjusted return potential by reducing investment risk and creating investment value.

ESG analysis can', 'its people, customers and the environment, we believe, is more likely to exhibit a greater level of resilience and outperform its peers than one that does not. ESG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors that can have a significant impact on the financial metrics of a company and therefore better inform our investment decisions.

When taking ESG considerations into account, it is not just a case of evaluating the products and services provided by a company, but also its behaviour, conduct, supply chain and other considerations in running the business. ESG analysis must also', 'a case of evaluating the products and services provided by a company, but also its behaviour, conduct, supply chain and other considerations in running the business. ESG analysis must also consider the future, taking into account not only a company’s latest ESG disclosures, but also its strategy, overall impact and evidence that it is keeping to its commitments and standards. Hence we believe it is not advisable to formulate investment decisions based on purely backward looking historical data and believe a more forward-looking, dynamic approach is needed when considering ESG risks and opportunities. This is why our proprietary ESG analysis', 'decisions based on purely backward looking historical data and believe a more forward-looking, dynamic approach is needed when considering ESG risks and opportunities. This is why our proprietary ESG analysis and ESG ratings are integrated into our credit research. While exclusion-based strategies adopt a negative approach to investing, our holistic approach to ESG takes a more positive stance and also looks for opportunities where companies are actively transitioning and improving their ESG profiles.
